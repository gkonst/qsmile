Installation

    1. Installing from source.

        To install qsmile you need simply unpack sources to some directory.
        If the required packages (Python, Qt4, sip and PyQt4) are not installed,
        please get them and install them in the following order (order is important):
            
            1) Install Python
            
            2) Install Qt4
            
            3) Build and install sip
            
            4) Build and install PyQt4
                   
            5) Install qsmile running 'python setup.py install' (you need administrator priviledges for this)
            
    2. Installing on Gentoo 
        
        You can install qsmile on Gentoo using two ebuilds:
            
            1) Using qsmile-999.ebuild you can install qsmile from latest sources in git repository.
            
            2) Using qsmile.ebuild you can install specific version of qsmile. 
               Just rename qsmile.ebuild to qsmile-X.Y.ebuild, where X.Y - version you want to install.
        
    3. Installing on Windows
        
        Just copy downloaded 'qsmile.exe' binary to some directory. That's all. =)
